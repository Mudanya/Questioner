#Questioner
Summary
Questioner is a platform that allows users to crowd-source questions for meetups. The admin creates meetups, and users can post questions on specific meetups.

Questioner allows the meetup organizer to prioritize the questions to be answered. Other users can vote on the asked questions, and they bubble to the top or bottom of the log.

Questioner-UI is a static site with no functionality. The project is managed on a pivotal tracker board. View the board here
